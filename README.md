Automatic Question Generation for A Given Code Snippet using LSTM algortihm

ABSTRACT:

    Stack Overflow is one of the most popular technical Q&A site used by software developers. 
Secking help from Stack Overflow has become an essential part of developersÂ° daily work for 
solving programming-related questions. 

        The Stack Overflow community recommends users to provide the related code snippet
when they are creating a question to help others better understand it and ofler their help. 
Although the Siack Overflow community has provided quality assurance guidelines to help 
users write better questions, it is observed that a significant number of questions submitted to 
Stack Overflow are of low quality. These poorly asked questions are less likely to reccive 
useful answers and hinder the overall knowledge generation and sharing process. 

      In this project, we develop a web-based service tool, which can help developers in 
writing high quality questions for a given code snippet. Considering one of the reasons for 
introducing low-quality questions in Stuck Overflow is that many developers may not be able 
to clarily and summarize the key problems behind their presented code snippets due to their 
lack of knowledge and terminology related to the problem. and/or their poor writing skills.
Sequence to Sequence model is a special class of Recurrent Neural Network architectures 
that is used to solve complex language problems like machine translation. question 
answering, creating chatbots, text summarization, etc. 

      We implement our project using the deep sequence-to-sequence learning approach. to assist 
developers in writing high-quality questions by automatically generating questions for a 
given code snippet.
